Parallax Project
Description
The Parallax Project is a Python-based application that transforms 2D images into a visually 3D effect using parallax scrolling. This project leverages computer vision techniques to create depth maps and apply a parallax effect to the input images, resulting in engaging, motion-based representations of the original static images.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

//
Python 3.x
pip (Python package manager)
//

Installation

Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

//
git clone https://github.com/your-username/parallax_project.git
cd parallax_project
//

Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your Python projects. Use the following commands to create and activate one:

//
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
//

Install all the required packages using pip:

//
pip install -r requirements.txt
//

To run the application, follow these steps:
Activate Virtual Environment

If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated:

//
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
//

Run the Script

Execute the main script with:

//
python app.py
//

NOTES:

1. Uninstall torch and reinstall "pip install torch torchvision" incase of missing file error
2. After every render, refresh the Webpage else the output will not show on screen
3. Use device with better processor and GPU for speed
4. Try to use smaller images with white background
5. Use inmages that have more DEPTH in its object components for best results


Usage
Provide instructions on how to use the application, including any command line arguments, input formats, and output expectations.
